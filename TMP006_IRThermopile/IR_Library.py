Overview

SERIAL BUS ADDRESS
- To communicate with the TMP006 or TMP006B, the master must first address slave devices via a slave address byte. 
- The slave address byte consists of 7 address bits, and 1 direction bit that indicate the intent to execute a read or write operation.

READ/WRITE OPERATIONS
- Access a particular register on the TMP006 and TMP006B by writing the appropriate value to the Pointer Register. 
- The pointer value is the first byte transferred after the slave address byte with the R/W bit low. 
- Every write operation to the TMP006 and TMP006B requires a value for the pointer (see Figure 7). 
- When reading from the TMP006 or TMP006B, the last value stored in the pointer by a write operation is used to determine which
register is read by a read operation. 
- To change the register pointer for a read operation, a new value must be written to the pointer. 
    - This transaction is accomplished by issuing a slave address byte with the R/W bit low,
    followed by the pointer byte. No additional data are required. 
    - The master can then generate a START condition and send the slave address byte with the 
    R/W bit high to initiate the read command. If repeated reads from thesame register are desired, 
    it is not necessary to continually send the pointer bytes because the TMP006 and TMP006B 
    retain the pointer value until it is changed by the next write operation. 
    
Note that register bytes are sent MSB first, followed by the LSB.

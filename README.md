# CluelessIoT: Mushrooms

## Initial brainstorming
1. IoT Ping Pong
2. School bag
3. Alarm: Motion sensors to track sleeping habits, bad dreams, wake you up
4. IoT Calculator: lasts longer, camera for scans, send log to computer
5. Lamp: motion sensor. adjust light automatically.measures room temperature and a corresponding light
   1. Sensors: spectral light sensor, thermopile, air temperature and humidity sensor
   2. Output: LED
6. **Humidity + temperature sensor: alarm for when to air the bed or wash your mattress**
   1. Air temperature and humidity sensor, thermopile, air quality sensor
   2. Output: Sounder
   3. Push button
   4. IoT: Take in weather data - when you can dry your clothes outdoors
7. Smart roller-blades: Tracking location, duration, skating exercise, calories burnt
8. Seat monitor: Weight sensor on each sensor
9. **Deaf translation: display for showing the british sign language**
   1.  Braille implemented by 6 servo motors or 6 LEDs.
   2.  Make our website blind-friendly
   3.  Sensors: USB microphone, camera

## Tasks for now
- [ ] Experiment with sensors: spectral light sensor, thermopile, air temperature and humidity sensor
- [ ] Research the physics behind optimal humidity and temperature for sleeping
- [ ] Correlation with weather?

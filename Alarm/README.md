# Alarm Library

This is a simple library to call the buzzer on ImFresh. The scheduling is dealt with the middleman.

## Constructor

The constructor does nothing.

```python
def __init__(self)
```

## Buzz

The buzz method by default allows the buzzer to buzz 10 times.

```python
def buzz(self, cycles=10)
```
